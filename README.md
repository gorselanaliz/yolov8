# YOLOv8 Computer Vision Tasks ðŸš€


This project leverages the power of YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) for real-time object detection. YOLOv8 is a state-of-the-art, fast, and accurate object detection algorithm that allows us to detect and classify multiple objects within images or video frames.

### Prerequisites

All you need to have is a Google account.

* Google Account
* Google Drive
* Google Colabratory (with GPU Runtime)

<br/>

### Installation

A step by step guide that will tell you how to get the development environment up and running. You can just follow the steps on the notebook which we provide you. 

First of all, you need to download dataset from the link we provide you in the dataset folder and put it in dataset file

```
$ git clone https://github.com/gorselanaliz/yolov8
$ cd <project_file>
```
If you are interested in pre-trained models, you can downloads model from the/weights folder of related project

## Usage

This project designs for Google Colab environment so all you need to do is following the steps in the notebooks.
There is no need to specific procedure to follow.
